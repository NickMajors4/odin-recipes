    <h2>Rice and Peas</h2>
    <p>Rice and Peas is a classic Jamaican side dish made with fluffy rice cooked in creamy coconut milk, seasoned with thyme, scallions, and allspice, and studded with tender red kidney beans 
        (the “peas” in the name). This fragrant dish is a staple in Caribbean cooking and is often paired with stews, curries, and jerk dishes. The combination of coconut richness and aromatic 
        spices makes it a perfect complement to bold-flavored mains like brown stew chicken or jerk pork.</p>
