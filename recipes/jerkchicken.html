     <h2 class="Description">Description</h2>
     <p>Jerk chicken is a flavorful Jamaican dish known for its bold, smoky, and spicy taste. It’s traditionally made by marinating chicken in a mixture of aromatic spices, fresh herbs, 
        Scotch bonnet peppers, and allspice (pimento), which is the signature ingredient of jerk seasoning. The chicken is then slow-cooked over pimento wood or grilled, allowing the marinade 
        to deeply penetrate the meat while creating a deliciously charred, crispy exterior. This cooking method infuses the chicken with layers of heat, sweetness, and smokiness that are both 
        distinctive and irresistible.Beyond its taste, jerk chicken carries a rich cultural heritage that traces back to the Maroons of Jamaica, who developed this cooking technique as a way to 
        preserve and flavor meat. Today, it is a staple of Jamaican cuisine and is often served with classic sides like rice and peas, fried plantains, or festival bread. Whether prepared at a 
        roadside stand or in a home kitchen, jerk chicken is celebrated worldwide as a vibrant representation of Jamaica’s culinary traditions and its bold, island flavors.</p>
